## Workflow Example

1. **Tester reports a bug**: The Tester adds a new bug to the system, detailing the issue.
2. **Project Manager monitors the bug status**: The Project Manager oversees the progress of the reported bugs.
3. **Tester assigns the bug to a Developer**: The Tester assigns the bug to an available Developer.
4. **Developer resolves the bug**: The Developer fixes the bug and updates its status to "resolved."
5. **Tester verifies and closes the bug**: The Tester verifies the resolution and closes the bug.
6. **Admin manages users if needed**: Admins can add, update, or delete user accounts.
